New Concepts I learned while researching about how to build this application:
- [[Edge Runtime]]
- [[Retrieval Augmented Generation]] 


I went with [[Next.JS]] to start my web-applications
I just ran the command below to set up my project 

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

To start with, I developed a simple landing page that just introduces the app and what it does as well as a get started button that leads to a sign in prompt

I set up the [[Clerk Auth]]

I just followed the steps laid out in their documentation(https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)
