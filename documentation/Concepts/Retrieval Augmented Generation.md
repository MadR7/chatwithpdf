Also known as RAG


RAGs are AI frameworks for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground LLMs on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLM's generative process. 

This prevents LLMs from "hallucination" information and providing misinformation. 



For our project, this is an extremely important context since we need our chatbot to fully understand the context of the PDF and only pull the information from the PDF so its accurate.
